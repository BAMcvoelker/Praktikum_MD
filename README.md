### G. Mallikarjuna Rao & T. D. Gunneswara Rao (2018): A quantitative method of approach in designing the mix proportions of fly ash and GGBS-based geopolymer concrete, Australian Journal of Civil Engineering, DOI: 10.1080/14488353.2018.1450716

## Abstract
This data set stems from a systematic lab study for selecting mix proportions for fly ash and GGBS- based geopolymer concrete. Very little information is available on complete methodology in designing the fly ash and GGBS-based geopolymer mix. The fly ash and GGBS were activated using sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide as alkaline activator solution. The Na2SiO3/NaOH (alkaline activator) ratio was taken as 2.5 and the concentration of NaOH solution was maintained at 8 M. The main parameters considered in this study were binder content and alkaline solution/ binder ratio for various combinations of fly ash and GGBS. The variables considered in this experimentation include: binder content (360, 420 and 450 kg/m3), proportions of fly ash and GGBS (70‚Äì30, 60‚Äì40 and 50‚Äì50), alkaline solution/binder ratios (0.45, 0.50, 0.55 and 0.60) and curing condition (outdoor curing and oven curing). Results concluded that the GGBS content, alkaline solution/binder ratio and curing condition are found to be most influential parameters on compressive strength and workability of geopolymer concrete. The work presents detailed examples of mix designs for various strengths.

## Your task:
You get 192 geopolymer recipes (digital materials), of which only 10 (randomly selected) materials have been validated in the lab. 
The goal is to discover materials with high compressive strength in the upper 5% quantile (top 9 out of 192 materials). 
### Use a data-driven approach to select the next promising material for validation. Your lab budget is 4 validations! (The laboratory validation can be found in the Excel table "MD_Example_solutions.xlsx".)

## Homework

Your task is to perform a material discovery according to slides 54 to 59 of the lecture notes. The required resources can be found on slide 55. . Please refer to the "MD_Example_solutions.xlsx" file for validation in the lab as per slide 56. Select ONE optimization objective from on slide 59. Describe your approach and justify your design decisions according to the workflow on slides 60 to 65 in a short report. The outline should follow this structure:

1. brief description of the optimization objective and input data.
2. selected input data (short rationale).
3. model selection (short rationale).
4. selected strategy (exploit vs. explore and exploit).
5. evaluation of the prediction and selection of the next candidate.

Repeat steps 3 to 5 at least twice if optimization is successful and a maximum of four times otherwise. 

6. summary of results and comparison with initial situation. 

Please make sure that your settings are well documented. 

## Troubleshooting:

If the app is not available, please write a short email to Christoph.Voelker@bam.de. 

To upload the "MD_Example.csv" file, YOU MUST CHANGE THE DELIMETER SETTINGS!!! Select: Separator: ";" & Decimal Separator: ","

If nothing happens after you click on "Make prediction" in the Materials Discovery window, make sure:

- that only numerical input data is selected, i.e. the name of the mixture "Mixture Code in Ref" must NOT be selected
- only the compressive strength "f,c(28d) (MPa) - MD1 Target" is selected as target.

To add the data in each iteration (see "Data-driven material design workflow" on slide 56), either open the "MD_Example.csv" file with Excel and save it again in CSV format, or simply open the file with a text editor and manually add the result to the end of the associated line. Make sure that you use the German decimal separator: ",".

If you are not sure what settings should be made, see the "Hands-on" section of the script for further instructions.
