## Abstract
This data set stems from a systematic lab study for selecting mix proportions for fly ash and GGBS- based geopolymer concrete. Very little information is available on complete methodology in designing the fly ash and GGBS-based geopolymer mix. The fly ash and GGBS were activated using sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide as alkaline activator solution. The Na2SiO3/NaOH (alkaline activator) ratio was taken as 2.5 and the concentration of NaOH solution was maintained at 8 M. The main parameters considered in this study were binder content and alkaline solution/ binder ratio for various combinations of fly ash and GGBS. The variables considered in this experimentation include: binder content (360, 420 and 450 kg/m3), proportions of fly ash and GGBS (70–30, 60–40 and 50–50), alkaline solution/binder ratios (0.45, 0.50, 0.55 and 0.60) and curing condition (outdoor curing and oven curing). Results concluded that the GGBS content, alkaline solution/binder ratio and curing condition are found to be most influential parameters on compressive strength and workability of geopolymer concrete. The work presents detailed examples of mix designs for various strengths.

Please use SLAMD to create the formulations according to the lecture script.
